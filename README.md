<h1>Poster 📊</h1>
I have created a poster which explained the experimental study I have conducted on different classification algorithms and recommended the preferred classifier for this dataset.
The pdf of the poster has been uploaded into the repository. I have also uploaded the R code used to create the plots and confusion matrices in the poster.
