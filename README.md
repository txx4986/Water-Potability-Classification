# Water-Potability-Classification ðŸ’§
This is an individual reseacrh poster project I have done during the summer term in university. <br />
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. It is owned by Aditya Kadiwal and the version I used is Version 3.<br />
Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability <br />

<h1>Poster ðŸ“Š</h1>
I have created a poster which explained the experimental study I have conducted on different classification algorithms and recommended the preferred classifier for this dataset.
The pdf of the poster named as [Year 1 Individual Research Project] (https://github.com/txx4986/Water-Potability-Classification/blob/main/Year%201%20Individual%20Research%20Project.pdf) has been uploaded into the repository. I have also uploaded the R code used to implement the classification algorithms as well as create the plots and confusion matrices in the poster. The codes are still very messy at the moment, but I will update them once I have time to do so!
